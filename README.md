## LadyBugs

You are given a **field size** and the **indexes where ladybugs** can be found on the field. On every new line, until the **"end"** command is given, a ladybug **changes its position** either to its **left** or to its **right** by a given **fly length**. 

A movement description **command** looks like this: "0 right 1". This means that the little insect **placed on index 0 should fly one index to its right**. If the ladybug **lands on another ladybug**, it **continues to fly in the same direction repeating the specified flight length**. If the ladybug **flies out of the field**, it is **gone**.
